# Saint Kitts and Nevis HDI Database: Tracing the Path of Human Development
Welcome to the Saint Kitts and Nevis HDI Database project! This repository aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the Human Development Index (HDI) for the dual-island country of Saint Kitts and Nevis.  The HDI is a composite index that measures key aspects of human development, such as life expectancy, education, and per capita income. 

This project utilizes a Jupyter Notebook to explore, visualize, and analyze HDI data from Saint Kitts and Nevis to understand the country's historical trends and the factors influencing its human development.
